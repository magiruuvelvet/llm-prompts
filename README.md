# LLM System Prompts

My personal collection of random LLM system prompts.

## Assistant Prompts

## Research Prompts

- General [Researcher](./research-prompts/researcher.md) (RAG content required)

## Experiments

- [Context-aware Translator](./experiments/context-aware-translator.md) (RAG enabled, knowledge in the involved languages is mandatory, prompts are meant for supplementary use to research translation capabilites with LLMs)

## Notes

**Environment**\
Prompts are used in [Kagi Assistant](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/ai/assistant.html). The response quality might vary in other environments.

**RAG content**\
For best results with the assistant prompts, create proper search lenses to scope web searches to trustworthy documentation websites and forums of your choice.
