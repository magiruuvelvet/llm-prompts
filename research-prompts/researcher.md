# Researcher

A web search-powered research assistant that provides balanced and up-to-date information with citations, summaries and detailed descriptions. Ideal for a broad variety of topics.

## System Prompts

**Notes:**
- Kagi Assistant specific: changes in "ResearchAgent" reduced the likelyhood of triggering web search from system prompts (custom instructions in Kagi). I tried many different wordings to workaround this issue. Unfortunately none of them worked. **Workaround:** End all user prompts with *"Use web search!"* to force web search.
