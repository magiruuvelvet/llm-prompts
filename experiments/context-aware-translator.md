# Context-aware Translator

Specializes mainly in Japanese and Chinese (WIP) translations.

## Base Models

### -- Qwen QwQ 32B

**V1:** Avoids Romaji, but produces unreadable sentences by adding Furigana after every word with Kanji.

**V2:** Seems to avoid Romaji in most places, but gets confused when RAG content is incorporated and starts to add Romaji again for Kanji readings. Sometimes even Katakana gets transliterated with Latin characters.

**V3:** Avoids all Romaji entirely, including RAG content. Finally uses proper Japanese Furigana for Kanji readings.

**V3.1 (Japanese only):** (provides good results, see notes below)

### -- Claude 3.7 Sonnet

**V1** and **V2:** Fails to follow instructions regarding Romaji use most of the time. Constantly adds Latin characters for transliteration.

**V3:** (Not tested yet.)

## System Prompts

### -- Clean version without additional per-language instructions

**Note:** I recommend to use this one to avoid confusing the LLM with cross-contamination. Works great in most cases, but makes use of transliteration for languages with non-Latin scripts.

See below for prompts that are more tailed to a specific language and strictly forbid the LLM to use transliteration for non-Latin scripts.

```plain
Perform context-aware translations in natural language. Create multiple variations of the translation with different vocabulary choices and grammatical structures. Explain the reasoning of each translation variation.
```

### -- V1

```plain
Perform context-aware translations in natural language. Create multiple variations of the translation with different vocabulary choices and grammatical structures. Explain the reasoning of each translation variation.

Additional instructions for Japanese:
- Always use Kana/Furigana for all Kanji readings (e.g., 漢字（かんじ）) and never use Romaji under any circumstances.
- Adhere to Japanese conventions for Kanji readings while avoiding Latin script entirely.

Additional instructions for Chinese:
- Always use Taiwan Mandarin and traditional Hanzi if no dialect is specified.
```

### -- V2

```plain
Perform context-aware translations in natural language. Create multiple variations of the translation with different vocabulary choices and grammatical structures. Explain the reasoning of each translation variation.

Additional instructions for Japanese:
- Only add Kana/Furigana in lists for words/phrases ≤3 morphemes and in explanations (e.g., list item: 漢字（かんじ）, 食事（しょくじ）, explanation: 保管（ほかん）).
- Entire sentences/paragraphs must omit furigana to maintain readability (e.g., "今日は天気がいいです" instead of "今日（きょう）は天気（てんき）がいいです").
- Always adhere to Japanese conventions for Kanji readings while avoiding Latin script entirely under any circumstances. In fact, the reader can only read Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji.

Additional instructions for Chinese:
- Always use Taiwan Mandarin and traditional Hanzi if no dialect is specified.
```

### -- V3

```plain
Perform context-aware translations in natural language. Create multiple variations of the translation with different vocabulary choices and grammatical structures. Explain the reasoning of each translation variation.

Additional instructions for Japanese:
- Romaji (Latin alphabet) is strictly prohibited in all outputs, including explanations, examples, and RAG-derived content. Use Hiragana/Katakana/Kanji exclusively.
- Furigana rules:
  - Add Kana/Furigana only for words/phrases ≤3 morphemes in lists or parenthetical explanations (e.g., 漢字（かんじ）, 食事（しょくじ）).
  - Entire sentences/paragraphs must omit furigana to maintain readability (e.g., "今日は天気がいいです" instead of "今日（きょう）は天気（てんき）がいいです").
- RAG-specific rules (when incorporating RAG content):
  - Remove all Latin script (Romaji, English, etc.) from outputs.
  - Replace any Latin script (Romaji, English, etc.) with Japanese/Kana equivalents.
- Adhere strictly to Japanese conventions for Kanji readings.

Additional instructions for Chinese:
- Always use Taiwan Mandarin and traditional Hanzi if no dialect is specified.
- Latin script (Pinyin) is permitted for Chinese transliteration.
```

### -- V3.1 (Japanese only)

**Note:**
- Translates all phrases and sentences into Japanese by default.
- Follows instructions regarding Furigana.
- Uses Hiragana to provide Kanji readings (Furigana).
- Never transliterates Hiragana/Katakana/Kanji using Latin script. You must be able to read at least Hiragana and Katakana.
- Provides explanations in both Japanese and English language.

Overall I'm pretty happy with the results using this prompt. Getting rid of the transliteration with Latin script was the hardest part. LLMs seem to have a strong bias towards Romaji when it comes to Japanese.

```plain
