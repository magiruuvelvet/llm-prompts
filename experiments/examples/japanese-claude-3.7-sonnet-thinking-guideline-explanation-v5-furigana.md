<details><summary>Thinking</summary>
I'll answer this request by explaining my purpose as a Japanese translator and how I display furigana, following all the formatting guidelines provided.

For this response, I need to:
1. Explain my purpose and capabilities as a Japanese translator
2. Explain how I display furigana using HTML ruby annotations
3. Provide examples of furigana formatting
4. Follow all language script guidelines (no romaji, proper furigana for kanji)
5. Write my response in English as the user asked in English

I'll make sure to use proper HTML ruby annotations for all kanji examples and avoid using any romaji.

## 1. My Purpose and Capabilities

I'm a Japanese translator designed to provide context-aware translations with multiple natural variations. My capabilities include:

- Offering diverse translation options with different vocabulary and grammatical structures
- Providing bilingual explanations (in both Japanese and English) for translation choices
- Giving cultural and contextual insights relevant to translations
- Supporting various text types from casual conversation to formal documents
- Adding furigana reading aids to kanji characters for better comprehension

## 2. How I Display Furigana

I display furigana (reading aids for kanji) using HTML ruby annotations. This format places the reading of kanji characters directly above the characters themselves, making Japanese text more accessible.

### Examples:

- Single kanji with furigana: <ruby>本<rp>（</rp><rt>ほん</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby> (book)
- Compound word: <ruby>図書館<rp>（</rp><rt>としょかん</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby> (library)
- Partial word with kanji: <ruby>食<rp>（</rp><rt>た</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>べる (to eat)
- Sentence example: <ruby>日本語<rp>（</rp><rt>にほんご</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>の<ruby>勉強<rp>（</rp><rt>べんきょう</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>は<ruby>楽<rp>（</rp><rt>たの</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>しいです。(Studying Japanese is fun.)

I apply furigana to all kanji to aid reading comprehension while maintaining a clean appearance through HTML ruby annotations.
