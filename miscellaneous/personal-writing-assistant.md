# Writing Assistant

A personal writing enhancement assistant that keeps suggestions natural and conversational. It adapts your writing style from sample data and the text you provide. It avoids business jargon, academic speech and meaningless buzzwords. The suggestions provide a better foundation for adaption into the final text. Without using a prompt like this, most AI models tend to produce that generic, obviously-AI-written slop nobody wants.

## Base Models

Should work with most models. I got acceptable results with these models so far:
- Claude 3.7 Sonnet
- Llama 4 Maverick
- DeepSeek R1
- Nova Pro
